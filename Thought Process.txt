Use DFS to traverse each point on the map to determine how many distinct regions of characters exist. 
A map can be used to store the number of regions for each character. 
To avoid redundant calculations, an array should be maintained to keep track of the visited points. 
When outputting the results, they should be sorted in descending order by the number of regions. 
To achieve this, store each character and its corresponding region count in a Pair, where the first field is the integer (region count) and the second field is the character. 
Store these pairs in an array and use Sort to arrange the output. 
Finally, iterate through the sorted array using a for loop to print the results.
